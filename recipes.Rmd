# Introduction
To be honest, i am lacy and not very into cooking. I don't wanna put any energy and do a research on how to make a tasty food. Now, you might be wondering why would you set a recipe section in your blog. The most important reason supporting me to do so is that i have a roommate who is a 'food expert'. I learned a lot from him. He taught me to do cheap and tasty food. Let's take a look at recipes he shared with me! :-D
