<h1>Literature 1</h1>
<p>Characterization of the Solute Dynamics Signature of an Agricultural Coastal Plain Stream, North Carolina, USA.</p>
<p><strong>Research motivation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In most cases, the stream restoration effects have been estimated, after restoration, by comparison between the restored and nearby ‘reference’ reaches, which can only add to the uncertainty of the estimation process.</li>
<li>The effects of stream restoration are confounded within the measurement uncertainty (discrete sampling and measuring).</li>
<li>Lack of available data complicated making a robust assessment for success or failure of stream restoration projects.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can one use in situ ultraviolet-visual (UV-vis) spectrophotometers to measure water quality on a continuous basis in an agricultural coastal plain stream? The answers to these very important questions are necessary to enrich guidance in the use of these instruments and create water quality rating curves to interpret the absorbance data.</li>
<li>The second question is: What are the uncertainties of concentrations and loads associated with data generated by the spectrophotometers? The answers related to the second question are to quantify the uncertainties associated with the spectrophotometers itself and compare the uncertainties for estimating annual loads with infrequent sampling.</li>
<li>What does continuous water quality information (e.g., flow, nutrient concentration and loads) reveal about biogeochemical processes at the short term (e.g., storm events) and seasonal scales in a coastal plain predominantly agricultural watershed? Can the information obtained be used to infer in- stream processes? The answers to the above questions are to characterize the nutrient dynamics from the continuous water quality information with seasonal effects and during the storm events.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Site description</strong></p>
<p>The research site is an agricultural coastal plain stream reach 2,200 m in length, thereafter referenced as the Claridge Canal, in Goldsboro, North Carolina (35.42∘N, 78.02∘W). This reach was slated to be restored from 2015 to 2016 for 12 months starting in autumn to offset the construction of Highway US70 Bypass. Three monitoring stations were installed as Upstream Station (UP), Middle Stream Station (MD, located 1,390 m from UP), and Downstream Station (DN, located 807 m from MD) for a total length of 2,197 m of the study reach (Figure 2.1, details in Appendix A.1). The drainage areas at UP, MD, and DN are 236 ha, 414 ha, 573 ha, respectively. The average slope of the stream was 1.93%.</p>
<p><strong>Water sample collection and measurements</strong></p>
<p>The embedded Global Calibration from the manufacturer for which the instrument provided turbidity (NTU), nitrate (NO3-N; mg/L), DOC (mg/L), and total organic carbon (TOC; mg/L) measurements every 15 minutes. At the same time interval, the Manta sonde measured Temperature (℃), pH, conductivity (µS/cm), turbidity (NTU), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM; μg/L). Sontek measured stage, temperature, and velocity. The automatic discrete sampler took discrete water samples, up to 1 L every 12 hours (12 am and 12 pm). All field instruments were serviced on a biweekly basis.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> for now, automatic discrete sampler took water samples every 14 hours. Considering bio- and chemical fouling on instruments and optics in particular, the team has installed an automatic cleaning tool to clean optics before each measurement.</p>
<p><strong>Biweekly field</strong></p>
<p>Cleaning optic lenses until the absorbance spectrum values in air and deionized water measurements were ‘flat’ and within 10 m^-1, i.e., similar to the original instrument setting. For the multi- parameter sonde, a detergent and toothbrush were used to clean the sensors except for CDOM sensor. CDOM sensor was cleaned with 2% HCl, a cotton swab and deionized water; the pH reference solution for pH sensor was changed every 2 months. The sensors in multi- parameter sonde were calibrated with standard solutions every 2-3 months. Laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>Lab analysis</strong></p>
<p>For each field visit, the discrete water samples were stored on ice and transported to the laboratory for analysis. The selections of the discrete samples for laboratory analysis depended on the initial water quality results from UV-Vis spectrophotometer and the flow events, i.e., the samples taken during flow events when concentrations change rapidly were preferentially selected.</p>
<p><strong>Handling of missing and erroneous flow data</strong></p>
<p>The accumulations of sand/leaves in the flumes and the growth of algae on the Doppler sensors could disturb the measured signal of Doppler velocity meters and induced noisy measurements and outliers. After removing the ‘spikes’ or obviously unreliable data points, the flow dataset was corrected by applying the moving average velocity method.</p>
<p>From the long-term observations on flow data, there were similar patterns and trends for the flow in both non-storm and storm event conditions between the three monitoring stations in the Claridge Canal. As a result, flow rates from one station could be reliably predicted from those of the other stations, using simple linear regressions around the missing data periods. To obtain the best results, with consideration of the distances between the three stations, the predicted flow at one station was derived from the nearest station with available flow data. All the filling work was accomplished in Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p><strong>Degradation sample study results</strong></p>
<p>A paired t-test was applied to evaluate the differences between the “Fresh” and “Degraded” samples for each water quality parameter (NO3-N, NH4-N, TDN, TKN, DOC, TP, and PO4-P) at the three stations for two-time periods: spring-summer, and fall-winter (The dates of each season were separated based on spring equinox, summer solstice, fall equinox, and winter solstice of the monitoring years.). There were several significant differences (α=0.05) between “Fresh” and “Degraded” samples in spring and summer, including NO3-N and NH4- N at MD and DN, TKN and TP at the three stations, and DOC at MD. There were no significant differences (α=0.05) between “Fresh” and “Degraded” samples for each water quality parameter at the three stations during the fall and winter period.</p>
<p><em>Notes: p &lt; 0.05 means there is significant difference between two samples</em></p>
<p>The consequence of this analysis is that when there was a significant difference (α=0.05) between ‘fresh’ and ‘degraded’ samples for the water quality parameters in spring and summer (Table 2.1), only the discrete samples collected within 48 hours prior to the field date were used to improve the quality of PLSR calibration. All the discrete samples collected in fall and winter were used in the PLSR calibration, as no significant degradation was found at these times.</p>
<p><strong>Global calibration vs discrete sample results</strong></p>
<p>The results showed significant linear correlations between discrete and raw instrument values with large departure from the one to one line. This justifies the need to find methods to create local calibration that can correct slope, intercept and RMSE. Hence PLSR method has been suggested.</p>
<p><strong>PLSR calibration fitting procedure</strong></p>
<p>For each parameter and each calibration period, the optimum number of components was chosen as the least number of components above which the percentage of the variance did not increase significantly and for which R² values were acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges and maintenance for the application of UV-Vis spectrophotometers in situ</strong></p>
<p>There are several main challenges associated with obtaining high-frequency water quality and hydrology data continuously, and keeping the monitoring system working properly in situ including: (1) biofouling on optics surface, (2) sufficient power supply, (3) heat supply in adverse weather, (4) animal effects and equipment maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3: Uncertainties assessment for continuous and infrequent sampling in measuring nutrient loads with the application of UV-Visual spectrophotometers in an agricultural coastal plain stream</strong></p>
<p><em>Research questions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of uncertainty should one expect on concentration and load values from continuous water quality instruments?</li>
<li>Can one develop guidance on how to minimize uncertainty with the use of these instruments using an affordable number of calibration points?</li>
<li>How do uncertainties associated with the UV- Vis sensors compare with those associated with infrequent sampling on the annual load indicator?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>As a result, the objectives of the research were addressed as follows: (1) evaluate the uncertainties on concentration values and annual loads calculated by the ‘global calibration’ provided by the manufacturer, and calculated using PLSR depending upon the number and the distribution of the calibration points used; (2) compare these uncertainties to those that would be induced by infrequent sampling on estimating annual loads with best load algorithm methods; (3) provide guidance to users to minimize uncertainties and maximize the potential of their UV-Vis spectrophotometers.</p>
<p><strong>Soil type in the investigated site</strong></p>
<p>The majority of the area is covered with sandy soils, although four hydraulic soil groups are present. Group A: soils (less than 10% clay, and more than 90 % sand; loamy sand; sandy loam) have low runoff potential and high infiltration rates when thoroughly wetted. Group B: soils (10%~ 20% clay, and 50%~ 90% sand; silt loam, silt) have moderately low runoff and moderate infiltration rates when thoroughly wetted. Group C: soils (20%~ 40% clay, and less than 50% sand; sandy clay loam; clay loam) have moderately high runoff potential and low filtration rates when thoroughly wetted. Group D: soils (greater than 40% clay, and less than 50% sand; silty clay loam; silty clay) have high runoff potential when thoroughly wetted and have high shrink-swell potential.</p>
