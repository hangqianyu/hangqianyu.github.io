# Datacamp - For R beginners
I am not good at codeing all my life!!! NEVER! But I benefited a lot from courses in [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home) which is recommended by Dr. Nelson and Dr. Birgand. So go there and enjoy your R Studio-ing if you are interested (maybe not for free though :-D)! 

# Optimize figures output
Rmarkdown is a really useful system for combining text, output and graphics generated by R/Rstudio into a single document. Figures, in particular, are a powerful means of communication in a report or your personal blog. To maximize the power of those images, Zev Ross has created a comprehensive list of [list of tips and tricks for working with images in R markdown document](https://www.zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/). Also, [10 tips for making your R graphics look their best](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2009/01/10-tips-for-making-your-r-graphics-look-their-best.html) is also recommended in particular:

* Use PNG for R graphics output, and use a high-resolution if you plan to print. Don't ever use JPG for R graphics output.
* Think about the aspect ratio of your graphics.
* Remove unused whitespace around your graphics (more of an issue for base R grahics; ggplot2 handles this pretty well already).

# Optimize tables output
I am also new to tables though. I previously used a [Markdown Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#) to generate tables which are really poor. I talked with my advisor to see if there is any solution to help with it. And here is a website you can refer to [Create Awesome HTML Table with knitr::kable and kableExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html). 

# Optimize color setting in R Studio
Another thing i wanna mention is color! You will definitely think about color when you try to make your audiences understood as quick as possible or when you are ready to submit your first manuscript to the journal. You can use hexadecimal codes to represent color. Here are two websites that i found useful to me.

* [R color cheatsheat](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf)
* [Colormap](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/colormap/latest/colormap.pdf)

# Make a nice report
Still learning, but refered a website [R markdown and Knitr](http://www.xueqing.tv/cms/article/101).

All right, i will go back learning coding, see you next time when i have something new to tell. Hope you enjoy!
