# Introduction
I think some people are transfering from Microsoft Word to R Markdown/R Bookdown to write a nice report. R Markdown is reproducible package in R Studio. People can know exactly what you did and repeat what you did! Nice, huh? So let's get it started! 

# Optimize figures output
Rmarkdown is a really useful system for combining text, output and graphics generated by R/Rstudio into a single document. Figures, in particular, are a powerful means of communication in a report or your personal blog. To maximize the power of those images, Zev Ross has created a comprehensive list of [list of tips and tricks for working with images in R markdown document](https://www.zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/). Also, [10 tips for making your R graphics look their best](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2009/01/10-tips-for-making-your-r-graphics-look-their-best.html) is also recommended in particular:

* Use PNG for R graphics output, and use a high-resolution if you plan to print. Don't ever use JPG for R graphics output.
* Think about the aspect ratio of your graphics.
* Remove unused whitespace around your graphics (more of an issue for base R grahics; ggplot2 handles this pretty well already).

# Optimize tables output
I am also new to tables though. I previously used a [Markdown Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#) to generate tables which are really poor. I talked with my advisor to see if there is any solution to help with it. And here is a website you can refer to [Create Awesome HTML Table with knitr::kable and kableExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html). 

# Optimize color setting in R Studio
Another thing i wanna mention is color! You will definitely think about color when you try to make your audiences understood as quick as possible or when you are ready to submit your first manuscript to the journal. You can use hexadecimal codes to represent color. Here are two websites that i found useful to me.

* [R color cheatsheat](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf)
* [Colormap](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/colormap/latest/colormap.pdf)

# Make a nice report
Still learning, but refered a website [R markdown and Knitr](http://www.xueqing.tv/cms/article/101). 

# Shortcuts

**Switch to another file in R studio** - Control + F11/f12

# Symbols
You would benefit from [A table](https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/Symbols.pdf) so much. Do not forget to add `$...$` between LATEX codes if you wanna insert a symbol. And do not forget to add `$$...$$` if you wanna insert a mathematical equation/symbol. Also, refer to the `tracer.Rmd` file for an example. 

**My experience till now**

1. Always do not use system code of rmarkdown to import images, otherwise your rmarkdown will suddenly break down one day. I encounted this problem recently. I, at first, thought it might be because i used wrong codes making it die. Then I checked all codes letter by letter which seems right though. And then i realized i imported a lot of images in Rmd files using `![image](img/path)` system code which must be too heavy for a "small" package. Like i recommended before, [list of tips and tricks for working with images in R markdown document](https://www.zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/) solved the problem and made images nicer! I used `include_graphics` function in `knitr` package for local downloaded images. For figures produced by R, you will need to choose another way to make it.

2. If you save your Rmd files in Google Drive, you might want to pause sync when you are working with Rmd files. Otherwise the error might frequently pop up when you try to make a change in the file. Just do not forget resuming Google Drive when you are done (I did once).

All right, i will go back learning coding, see you next time when i have something new to tell. Hope you enjoy!
