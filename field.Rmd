# Introduction
For claridge project, we usually go there biweekly to do a manual service/check. There are several reasons: 1) we used isco sampler to automatically collect water samples every 14 hours, but We need to replace full bottles with empty ones after two weeks. 2) download data because S::CAN and sontek data can only be stored within a short period of time. 3) check solar and marine battery. 4) manually clean Manta, Sontek, and S::CAN probe lenser. 5) take grab samples back to the lab for detecting if there is any difference between samples measured immediately and samples measured after two weeks. 6) take muanal flow measurement 7) download Manta data 8) clean the flume and stream, sometimes there will be plenty of trims/algae in streams 9) cut the grass because summer is coming. 10) grab tributary samples back to the lab. 11) finally check everything works all right, then you are good to go. 

In this part, i will mainly record some interesting stories i have seen (some are research-related, some are not) during each field visit. Go Pack, Go Field!

**Bird nest in CLMD station**

Amazing! There is a close-packed box in CLMD station. Inside the box, there is a bird nest hatching birds. I really do not know how did there parents build a nest inside a close box. Perhaps after i opened the box, they started building it. And I did not realize it (uhh...too focus on research? ^^). I wondered how will their parents find them after i closed the door. But at least, they are safe for another two weeks. Hope they will fly away soon to get food and find their parents.

**Cleaning tool of S::CAN probe only cleanes one side of probe lenses**

Another interesting and problematic question is that cleaning tool of S::CAN lenses only touches one side of the probe based on the mounting equipment. The problem cannot solved by manually adjusting the position of the cleaning tool. It is an old S::CAN probe, but pretty robust. I will bring a new probe to replace it if i cannot find a solution.

To do list:

* Download groundwater data (Not yet)
* Check the mechanical wiper's position (Done)
* Calibrate pH measurement (Done)

**Birds have gone**

Birds have grown and flown away. I did not move the nest just in case they will come back sometimes. Picture was not taken. Welcome you guys come back!

**Grassy stream**

The temperature is getting higher and higher. Weeds and insects are really everywhere. So cleaning flume, sontek, manta and spectrolyser lenses are thus crucial. For spectro lenses in CLUP station, the fingerprint maximum for DI water after cleaning (three times!!!) is 16, which is still more than 10. What might be the reason? I guess there are a lot of branches, algae and grasses in the stream, which may significantly polluted the lenses. However, lenses in CLDN and CLMD station are perfect. I will didcuss it with Francois next week to find a solution.

Sam and I will wipe a path for walking next time. 

**Tablet work**

Previously, i did a lot of stream work. So not good at tablet work. Recently, i did several tablet work and knew how everything (almost) works. Yeah! Finally.
