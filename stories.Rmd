* The poem i personally like:

**The Road Not Taken** - by *Robert Frost*

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

And sorry I could not travel both

And be one traveler, long I stood

And looked down one as far as I could

To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,

And having perhaps the better claim,

Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

Though as for that the passing there

Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay

In leaves no step had trodden black.

Oh, I kept the first for another day!

Yet knowing how way leads on to way,

I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh

Somewhere ages and ages hence:

Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”

I took the one less traveled by,

And that has made all the difference.

Things have been changing so fast.

### Chicago (12/28/2018 - 12/31/2018)

Life is like a giant circle track, you, at first, learn how to crawl and walk when you are a child, enjoy running till middle-aged, then you learn how to slow down your pace and respect the scenery you walked through. You might encounter some of your old friends, sometimes not. People have their own pace and direction. We do not know when we will meet each other, but we do know we always support them no matter what they are pursuing for. Till the end of this year, i am planning to visit Chicago to hang out with Quan and Ruoxi. To be honest, i have not been outside of North Carolina till now. So it might be a great chance to go ourside and have different views about America.

Stories will be updated after i went back.
