# Introduction
Based on what i have read through literature, here are some notes and thoughts.

# Literature 1
Characterization of the Solute Dynamics Signature of an Agricultural Coastal Plain Stream, North Carolina, USA.

**Research motivation**

* In most cases, the stream restoration effects have been estimated, after restoration, by comparison between the restored and nearby ‘reference’ reaches, which can only add to the uncertainty of the estimation process.
* The effects of stream restoration are confounded within the measurement uncertainty (discrete sampling and measuring).
* Lack of available data complicated making a robust assessment for success or failure of stream restoration projects.

**Research Questions**

* Can one use in situ ultraviolet-visual (UV-vis) spectrophotometers to measure water quality on a continuous basis in an agricultural coastal plain stream? The answers to these very important questions are necessary to enrich guidance in the use of these instruments and create water quality rating curves to interpret the absorbance data.
* The second question is: What are the uncertainties of concentrations and loads associated with data generated by the spectrophotometers? The answers related to the second question are to quantify the uncertainties associated with the spectrophotometers itself and compare the uncertainties for estimating annual loads with infrequent sampling.
* What does continuous water quality information (e.g., flow, nutrient concentration and loads) reveal about biogeochemical processes at the short term (e.g., storm events) and seasonal scales in a coastal plain predominantly agricultural watershed? Can the information obtained be used to infer in- stream processes? The answers to the above questions are to characterize the nutrient dynamics from the continuous water quality information with seasonal effects and during the storm events.

**Site description**

The research site is an agricultural coastal plain stream reach 2,200 m in length, thereafter referenced as the Claridge Canal, in Goldsboro, North Carolina (35.42∘N, 78.02∘W). This reach was slated to be restored from 2015 to 2016 for 12 months starting in autumn to offset the construction of Highway US70 Bypass. Three monitoring stations were installed as Upstream Station (UP), Middle Stream Station (MD, located 1,390 m from UP), and Downstream Station (DN, located 807 m from MD) for a total length of 2,197 m of the study reach (Figure 2.1, details in Appendix A.1). The drainage areas at UP, MD, and DN are 236 ha, 414 ha, 573 ha, respectively. The average slope of the stream was 1.93%.

**Water sample collection and measurements**

The embedded Global Calibration from the manufacturer for which the instrument provided turbidity (NTU), nitrate (NO3-N; mg/L), DOC (mg/L), and total organic carbon (TOC; mg/L) measurements every 15 minutes. At the same time interval, the Manta sonde measured Temperature (℃), pH, conductivity (µS/cm), turbidity (NTU), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM; μg/L). Sontek measured stage, temperature, and velocity. The automatic discrete sampler took discrete water samples, up to 1 L every 12 hours (12 am and 12 pm). All field instruments were serviced on a biweekly basis. 

**Notes:** for now, automatic discrete sampler took water samples every 14 hours. Considering bio- and chemical fouling on instruments and optics in particular, the team has installed an automatic cleaning tool to clean optics before each measurement. 

**Biweekly field**

Cleaning optic lenses until the absorbance spectrum values in air and deionized water measurements were ‘flat’ and within 10 m^-1, i.e., similar to the original instrument setting. For the multi- parameter sonde, a detergent and toothbrush were used to clean the sensors except for CDOM sensor. CDOM sensor was cleaned with 2% HCl, a cotton swab and deionized water; the pH reference solution for pH sensor was changed every 2 months. The sensors in multi- parameter sonde were calibrated with standard solutions every 2-3 months.
Laboratory.

**Lab analysis**

For each field visit, the discrete water samples were stored on ice and transported to the
laboratory for analysis. The selections of the discrete samples for laboratory analysis depended on the initial water quality results from UV-Vis spectrophotometer and the flow events, i.e., the samples taken during flow events when concentrations change rapidly were preferentially selected.

**Handling of missing and erroneous flow data**

The accumulations of sand/leaves in the flumes and the growth of algae on the Doppler
sensors could disturb the measured signal of Doppler velocity meters and induced noisy measurements and outliers. After removing the ‘spikes’ or obviously unreliable data points, the flow dataset was corrected by applying the moving average velocity method. 

From the long-term observations on flow data, there were similar patterns and trends for
the flow in both non-storm and storm event conditions between the three monitoring stations in the Claridge Canal. As a result, flow rates from one station could be reliably predicted from those of the other stations, using simple linear regressions around the missing data periods. To obtain the best results, with consideration of the distances between the three stations, the predicted flow at one station was derived from the nearest station with available flow data. All the filling work was accomplished in Microsoft Excel.
