# Abstract
  A growing number of stream restoration projects have been undertaken to counteract the adverse effects of stream degradation worldwide. Nevertheless, controversies on the real impacts of stream restoration still exist. The objective of this paper is to review the current knowledge base on the impacts of stream restoration in water quality, hydromorphology and fish/invertebrate community. Based on the database developed in this study, 67% of projects indicated a positive effect of nitrogen reduction following restoration. Hydromorphological improvements were identified almost by all hydromorphological restoration efforts. As fish/invertebrate community require a long time-frame to recover, reaching common ground can therefore be difficult due to different time-frames applied by researchers. Given that restoration studies are usually site- and approach-specific, it is impossible to predict every outcome of a stream restoration project by simply extrapolating the results from one single study. However, finding some robust indicators for which could show the uniform trend following restoration is helpful for evaluating the effectiveness of stream restoration projects. Several future research needs should be highlighted: 1) implement high-resolution data analysis, in particular for water quality; 2) choose robust indicators for restoration project evaluation; and 3) avoid comparison using nearby reference streams.

# 1. Introduction
A nationwide investigation found that among 16% assessments of 3.5 million stream miles in the United States in 2004, 44% of them were identified as impaired or polluted [@RN1820]. Countless streams had highly altered flows or were geomorphically degraded [@RN1823]. Over the last two decades, growing public sensitivity toward environmental degradation and scientific awareness of the ecological and biological importance of water quality and hydromorphological diversity in streams have driven numerous attempts to recover degraded systems [@RN1857; @RN1846]. Stream restoration, an effort to reshape "more complex ecosystems from more simple and degraded states" [@RN1813], is a relatively young science and has been considered as a major enterprise, with most focusing on benthic invertebrates, fish population or geomorphic channel stability in the United States [@RN1826; @RN1827; @RN1824]. An average of more than $1 billion a year were spent on stream and river restoration in the US [@RN1814].  

However, early in the 1990s, [-@RN1815] stated that many "walking aways" from restoration projects after construction without systematic monitoring forfeited the investment if the project failed and prevented the next generation of projects from benefiting from the effort if the project was successful. For instance, [-@RN1822] quantified and summarized pre-restoration data on water quality, pesticides concentrations, chlorophyll a, physical in-stream habitat, and biotic community (fish analysis) from the project on Gypsum Creek in Wichita, Kansas. They indicated a potential improvement of stream water quality, physical habitat, and biotic integrity by stream restoration. However, no further publications on the overall effects of stream restoration have been seen probably due to lack of further funding from the state and local management agencies, or literally no effects at all.

Yet, researchers have been trying to quantify the effects of stream restoration with respect to: i) water quality, ii) hydromorphology, iii) riparian zones connection, iv) in-stream habitat, and v) biotic communities. There were five commonly stated goals in the US based on the National River Restoration Science Synthesis (NRRSS) database [@RN1814]. Controversial voices have still been around debating whether stream restoration is worthwhile or not [@RN1821]. Each individual study can show important characteristics and combining them, as performed in this review, can help illustrate trends. The objective of this paper was to review the current knowledge base on the impacts of stream restoration in water quality, hydromorphology, and biotic communities and can also identify future research needs.

# 2. Stream Restoration Goals
To date, there has been a substantial amount of publications on stream restoration. A dramatic increase of publications containing keywords, either 'stream restoration' or 'stream restoration effects', was observed since the 1990s from google scholar searching (include patents) (Fig. 1).
